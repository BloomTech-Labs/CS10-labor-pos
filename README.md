## Tech Stack

### Frontend built using:

- React.js
- Material Design
- GraphQL & Apollo
- Netlify

Deployed [here](https://bestpos.netlify.com/)

### Backend built using:

- PostgresQL
- GraphQL & Graphene
- bcrypt
- Heroku

Deployed [here](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/labs7-posserver)

### Reasoning:

- React.js

  - We selected React as our frontend framework because we knew with the application we were planning on building, there were going to be a lot of reusable components all interacting with each other.

- Material Design

  - The styling of Material UI components has always appealed to our team, so we jump at any opportunity to integrate it into our varied projects. Our goal for this application was to be utilitarian without seeming as though we were making no effort on improving user experience, so Material UI just seemed like the good fit.

- GraphQL/Apollo Client

  - We made the decision early on to attempt to make this application with GraphQL instead of REST as none of the team had worked on a GraphQL project of this scale and we were all keen to learn what we could learn from being in the thick of it, as it were. We also realized that a lot of the data we would need from our server would be subject to change over time and that editing queries and mutations in GraphQL is a lot simpler than rewriting REST endpoints.

- Netlify

  - In a bid to reduce the number of independent variables at play in the application (as a lot of the decisions we made early on about tech stack choice were with the intent of learning a lot of new technology), we opted to deploy using a platform we had all independently been successful at deploying from at some point or another.

- PostgresQL

  - We chose a SQL database database because we felt that the necessary components of our application related to each other and would be best implemented in a relational database. We chose PostgresQL specifically because it was the backend support most recommended by Django, which we had already decided would be our backend framework, for its support of schemas.

- Django

  - We knew that with an application of this size and structure and with the intent to use GraphQL, we would be needing to check our data thoroughly and often. The built-in admin interface through Django was a big selling point in our decision to use Django, believing that it would save us a lot of time upfront due to the increased speed of testing.

- GraphQL

  - We knew that the models we were dealing with were very closely related to each other and that the way in which we wanted to display that data to users called for a lot of connected queries to the database. Using GraphQL in lieu of REST (while having an initial setup cost of having to make sense of the various documentation) has made a lot of the communication between client and server more efficient.

- Graphene

  - As we had made the decision to use GraphQL and Django, Graphene was kind of a necessary technology as it helped to bridge the gap between Django and GraphQL.

- Bcrypt

  - Django's default hashing algorithm is PBKDF2 but we were more familiar with bcrypt password hashing, having implemented it in every security-based project, so felt safer using it as our password hashing algorithm.

- Heroku
  - We chose Heroku for roughly the same reason we chose Netlify, with the addendum that we also wanted a deployment site that would interact well with a Postgres database.

# Authentication:

Authentication is being handled with the use of JSON Web Tokens through graphql_jwt.

# Authorization:

Authorization is handled on the model level, with each model query checking to see if the requesting party is anonymous, restricting access if they are, and filtering responses to limit access to only those items the particular requesting party has created.

# Security:

- Work on security is ongoing.

## Models

### User Model

Using AbstractUser() to extend Django User in order to add fields to the User model without stepping on its toes. This model represents the user of the application.

Fields being used from Django User model:

```
- username
- password
- email
```

Fields added to the User model:

```
- first_name (CharField(max_length=30))
- last_name (CharField(max_length=150))
- street_address (CharField(max_length=100))
- city (CharField(max_length=70))
- state (CharField(max_length=50, choices=state_choices))
- state choices = (
  ("AL", "Alabama"),
  ("AK", "Alaska"),
  ("AZ", "Arizona"),
  ("AR", "Arkansas"),
  ("CA", "California"),
  ("CO", "Colorado"),
  ("CT", "Connecticut"),
  ("DC", "District of Columbia"),
  ("DE", "Delaware"),
  ("FL", "Florida"),
  ("GA", "Georgia"),
  ("HI", "Hawaii"),
  ("ID", "Idaho"),
  ("IL", "Illinois"),
  ("IN", "Indiana"),
  ("IA", "Iowa"),

- modified_at (DateTimeField(auto_now=True))
- premium = (BooleanField(default=False, blank=True, null=True))
- paid_until = (DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True))
```

### Client Model

Client model is the overarching model for contracts the user has. They may have several jobs under the same client, so there are jobs linked to the client model.

Fields on the Client model:

```
- user (ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE ))
- business_name (CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True, default=""))
- first_name (CharField(max_length=100, default=""))
- last_name (CharField(max_length=100, default=""))
- email = EmailField(max_length=70, default="")
- street_number = CharField(max_length=10, default="")
- unit_number = CharField(max_length=10, null=True, blank=True, default="")
- street_name = CharField(max_length=100, default="")
- city = CharField(max_length=70, default="")
- state = CharField(max_length=2, choices=state_choices)
- state_choices = (
        ("AL", "Alabama"),
        ("AK", "Alaska"),
        ("AZ", "Arizona"),
        ("AR", "Arkansas"),
        ("CA", "California"),
        ("CO", "Colorado"),
        ("CT", "Connecticut"),
        ("DC", "District of Columbia"),
        ("DE", "Delaware"),
        ("FL", "Florida"),
        ("GA", "Georgia"),
        ("HI", "Hawaii"),
        ("ID", "Idaho"),
        ("IL", "Illinois"),
        ("IN", "Indiana"),
        ("IA", "Iowa"),
        ("KS", "Kansas"),
        ("KY", "Kentucky"),
        ("LA", "Louisiana"),
        ("ME", "Maine"),
        ("MD", "Maryland"),
        ("MA", "Massachusetts"),
        ("MI", "Michigan"),
        ("MN", "Minnesota"),
        ("MS", "Mississippi"),
        ("MO", "Missouri"),
        ("MT", "Montana"),
        ("NE", "Nebraska"),
        ("NV", "Nevada"),
        ("NH", "New Hampshire"),
        ("NJ", "New Jersey"),
        ("NM", "New Mexico"),
        ("NY", "New York"),
        ("NC", "North Carolina"),
        ("ND", "North Dakota"),
        ("OH", "Ohio"),
        ("OK", "Oklahoma"),
        ("OR", "Oregon"),
        ("PA", "Pennsylvania"),
        ("RI", "Rhode Island"),
        ("SC", "South Carolina"),
        ("SD", "South Dakota"),
        ("TN", "Tennessee"),
        ("TX", "Texas"),
        ("UT", "Utah"),
        ("VT", "Vermont"),
        ("VA", "Virginia"),
        ("WA", "Washington"),
        ("WV", "West Virginia"),
        ("WI", "Wisconsin"),
        ("WY", "Wyoming"),
        ("PR", "Puerto Rico"),
        ("VI", "Virgin Islands"),
        ("GU", "Guam"),
    )
- zipcode = CharField(max_length=10)
- created_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
- modified_at = DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
- deadline = DateField(blank=True, null=True)
```

### Job Model

We envision jobs to be broken down pieces of contracts that may have different deadlines and requirements than each other.

Fields on the Job model:

```
- user = ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
- client = ForeignKey(Client, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
- name = CharField(max_length=200)
- description = TextField(null=True)
- complete = BooleanField(default=False)
- labor = DecimalField(decimal_places=2, max_digits=5, null=True)
- created_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
- modified_at = DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
- deadline = DateField(blank=True, null=True)
```

### Part Model

Parts are things that can be added to a job to further describe the work being completed and are what combine to allow us to form an invoice for the user.

Fields on the Part Model:

```
- user = ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
- job = ForeignKey(Job, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
- name = CharField(max_length=100)
- description = TextField()
- cost = DecimalField(decimal_places=2, max_digits=5)
```

### Note Model

The ability for our users to add notes to jobs and clients.

Fields on the Note Model:

```
- user = ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
- client = ForeignKey(Client, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True)
- job = ForeignKey(Job, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True)_
- title = CharField(max_length=200)
- content = TextField()
- created_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
- modified_at = DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

## Queries

### On User Model:

- user(id: ID!) query will search for a single id and return the client with that id (can also return clientSet, jobSet, noteSet, and partSet - so edge/node returns of associated items(which can be filtered))
- allUsers query will return all users (this is for our testing, not for the frontend - filtering by logged in user will be in place after testing)

### On Client Model:

- client(id: ID!) query will search for a single id and return the client with that id(can also return jobSet and noteSet - so edge/node returns of associated items (which can be filtered))
- allClients query will return all clients for the logged in User

### On Job Model:

- job(id: ID!) query will search for a single id and return the job with that id(can also return noteSet, and partSet - so edge/node returns of associated items (which can be filtered))
- allJobs query will return all jobs for the logged in User

### On Note Model:

- note(id: ID!) query will search for a single id and return the note with that id
- allNotes query will return all notes for the logged in User

### On Part Model:

- part(id: ID!) query will search for a single id and return the part with that id (can also return associated jobs
- allParts query will return all parts for the logged in User

# Styles and Theming

This project uses the Material Ui theme provider which cascades the defined theme down to all material ui components.
Theme can be viewed and edited in App.js

## Light and Dark Themes

Once logged in, the user can click a switch in the sidenav to switch between a light colored and dark colored theme.
The theme choice is saved on localstorage and localstorage is checked for a theme choice on reload.

# Installation Instructions
